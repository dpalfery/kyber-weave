# code-reviewer migration

## Hotshot golden baseline

The canonical agent description and instruction body were synchronized from `.github/agents/code-reviewer.agent.md` at
Hotshot commit `677c3a876ba9c62f1083608596b238c9deaff167`. The selected source file's SHA-256 is recorded in frontmatter,
while `final-body-sha256` is the SHA-256 of the UTF-8, LF-normalized instruction body after
YAML frontmatter is removed.

The body has since evolved by one paragraph: what to do when the harness gives the reviewer no
tool for invoking another agent, as on Devin (ADR 0025). `final-body-sha256` covers that
evolved body.

## Canonical projection

Target-neutral `invocation`, `model-profile`, `capability-profile`, `delegates-to`, `fallback`,
and `aliases` remain canonical lifecycle fields. The `copilot-tools` field preserves exact golden
membership; Copilot rendering applies only the approved deterministic ordering.
